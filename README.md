# ASRandBBW
The purpose of this exercise is to specify two sub sub-systems which are going to be tackled in this exercise are the anti system (ASR) and the brake The goal of the ASR is to avoid that comparing to the others wheel due to a hard acceleration or a slippery surface. Thus, the system has to reduce the speed engine or to apply the brake on the concerned wheel(s). It also warns the driver while this sy alarm light. The brake-by-wire system has for main purpose to replace the physical connection from cars between the brake pedal and the brakes by a computer system. The challenge of this sub brake pedal will reach in time the brakes and that in feedback the brakes will give the current pressure applied on them in order to give the feeling of resistance on the pedal while the driver is pushing it.
